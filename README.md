# Riddle-Me-This Game Project

This is the 3rd project from the Full Stack Development course from Code Institute. The project comprises of a simple game of Q&A or Riddles to be answered by the user.

## UX

The idea is to have a simple and clean UX, but also made interesting by the always changing background images. No CSS Framerworks were used. Instead, I focused on using CSS Flexbox and Grid, where/if necessary.

## Features

* The first page of app introduces de game and request the user's name.

* Once logged in, the game will present the user with a series of 10 riddles, one by one, and will award 1 point for ever correct answer. The user has 3 changes to answer correctly, before the game moves on to the next Riddle.

* Colour coded warining messages are presented, based on the user's response.

* The user can access the Scoreboard and the homepage without being logged out. By pressing "Return", the user is directed back to the game.
